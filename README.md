# Logger
 Problem Statment:- create an event trigger with every new file created.
 Watchdogs library used to monitor file system events.https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/
 
 File logger creates a logger using watchdogs library and montiors any changes made to a file in a paticular directory.
 The changes made to the file are then logged into a CSV file with the time stamp and the file name and file location.
 The program runs in the background recording any changes and uses a Rotatingfile handler  function to create multiple log files, thus limiting a paticular test log file   within a specific space.
